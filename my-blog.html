        <p>In 2018, I arranged a 3-days and 4-nights trip at Saint Martin island. I was influenced to make a trip there
            from
            an elder brother of my campus. He is a hodophile, just like me. Saint Martin is prohibited for tourist
            gatherings from April to September. We started to plan the budget for this trip from November 18 I hosted a
            public event on social media for the interested tourists to join with us and got a tremendous response. 55
            People booked for the trip. Lastly, 40 people from different backgrounds, Mostly my fellow classmates,
